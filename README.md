# Moonleaf-Game

Thank you to all who agreed to test!
This being the first build, I am looking for general feedback: movement speed, dialogue, and general feel being the most important. Obviously, much of the textures and such are not in yet, but please also evaluate those that appear to be in. Post comments, bugs, and issues on the discord planning channel, and make sure to @dev your comments so we know where to look. Thank you!

# Moonleaf-Game

Thank you to all who agreed to test!

Moonleaf is now v0.2.2

Testing is now open-ended - there's no new story, but a lot of new QOL and small fixes. Let me know if you find anything!

PS- I am well aware that the projectile impact effect faces the wrong direction on vertical surfaces. I'm working on it.

# Moonleaf-Game

Thank you to all who agreed to test!
Alrighty, testing hats on. The whole map should be in at this point (barring one area that is for now a secret, and I don't have the tilemaps done so there's that too), which means this week's focus is the transition system. Try and break it, let me know if it feels clunky, or if there's a tweak you would make. Additionally, the save system should be working, so test that out as well. This week we're looking for more secondary feedback on the basics - movement speed, dialogue, art, etc. Please call out anything that looks wrong, feels wrong, or is wrong. Remeber to post all the recommendations (and bugs) in the discord, and to @dev so we know where to look.
Thank you again!

# Moonleaf-Game

Thank you to all who agreed to test!
PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE ARE TWO WEEKS WORTH OF TESTING NOTES. PLEASE READ ALL OF THEM THOROUGHLY AND TRY TO ANSWER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!
Alrighty, testing hats on. The whole map should be in at this point (barring one area that is for now a secret, and I don't have the tilemaps done so there's that too), which means this week's focus is the transition system. Try and break it, let me know if it feels clunky, or if there's a tweak you would make. Additionally, the save system should be working, so test that out as well. This week we're looking for more secondary feedback on the basics - movement speed, dialogue, art, etc. Please call out anything that looks wrong, feels wrong, or is wrong. Remeber to post all the recommendations (and bugs) in the discord, and to @dev so we know where to look.
Thank you again!

Second week testing notes:
Combat has been implemented, so the testing focus is combat. Aim with the mouse, and fire with the left mouse button. Note that you must be facing the target in order to hit them, and without different art, it's relatively hard to tell which way you are facing. Additionally, the HUD should be working (though not in the starting area, that's on purpose). The major focus of this is the health bar. I'm looking for feedback both on how it looks and feels, and how it interacts when you take damage. As always, @dev the discord with all pointers and bugs, and thank you for testing!

# Moonleaf-Game

Thank you to all who agreed to test!

Moonleaf is now v0.2.0

Notes for this week:
As progress has moved rather quickly over the last few weeks, there's a lot to cover. Below is a list of the most important things to test in this build.

- Movement
- Art (this is a very general one, basically if anything feels off to you, or if you don't like the way something looks just point it out)
- Health and Healing (healing stations are placed around, use them to refill health- because death is now a possibility)
- Upgrades (upgrade stations have been placed around as well, which improve either health, firing speed, or movement speed)
- Lines and Story (if you think something's a typo, please point it out, also if a line feels clumsy or doesn't make sense please point it out as well)
- Enemy AI

Thank you again for playing, and please remember to @dev in the planning channel of the discord with a list of fixes and improvements so we can find them!

BONUS NOTES FROM NATE'S TESTING (15/07):
- Respawn should be at the entrance you use into an area, so you don't spawn in a cluster of enemies
- Cursor should no longer appear while the game is paused
- Enemies should be unable to move once the player has interacted with a beacon
- Wall art has been changed to a different style - I would love feedback on how the walls look for this iteration
